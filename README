Currently the following scenario is handled improperly:
1. User A loads a record
2. User B loads the same record
3. User A modifies the record
4. User B modifies the record

The application should detect in step 4. that it modifies stale data. It does not do it. This is wrong.
The hbncontainer-test1 project handles this properly (a shared SessionFactory is used in hbncontainer-test1).
